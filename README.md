# Fitness Tracker

## Description

This app uses Express with MongoDB as the database and a Mongoose schema. 

When users go to the home page, they're presented with their last logged workout. Here they can choose to either click 'Continue Workout' where they can update an existing workout, or they can click 'New Workout' to add a new one. 

Users can also click 'Dashboard' at the top of the page to view their stats.
